well, this function is in its early phase for now, so there may be some other bug, if there are bugs you can consult me ​​on my discord ElAnthonyVixtin#6843.

The steps are the following:
1. noteInfo.json, this file is to set the important values ​​of the special notes, for the note to work in the global notes hscript, you have to put this in the JSON ("id": "name of the note that want"), and so you have it configured.

2. notetypes.txt, this file is for the global names of the notes that will be used to identify it in the chart editor.

	example:
		StarNotes
		AngelNotes
		SkyNotes

3. notetypes.hscript, ok this file is the one that contains the attributes and advanced properties for the note, this file is optional, but if you want advanced functions take the template and rename it to notetypes, then you have 4 sections available, start, update, goodNoteHit, noteMiss, you also have 2 optional ones although I don't think they are of much use, stepHit and beatHit, you can open the file and read the other instructions.

4. use the template and rename it to "notetypes.hscript".

I hope I've helped.
enjoy. ;)
